### Project Overview

 This project is about creating a class list and the marks obtained by the students in maths. Later we decided to choose the maths topper to award him a certificate and for that we have to find who has scored the maximum marks in maths.On certificate the name should be displayed like last name and then first name but all the latters should be in uppercase
so for that we use upper(). This project is all about basic knowledge of lists , dictionaries and addition of strings..
